## Overview

**Project Title**: MadLibsSite

**Project Description**: A MadLibs website where a user is prompted to input words which are then used to create silly sentences.

**Project Goals**:

Build a website that receives input from a user, checks it for errors, and stores it. The stored values are then used to create silly sentences. The program creates new webpages dynamically for each sentence.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. In the terminal, execute `npm run dev`
2. The terminal should give you the website where the program is running. If not, it is likely `http://localhost:5173/`
3. Play around on the website.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Click "Generate new MadLib" and fill out words.
2. Click "Back to Home" to return to Home and fill out a new MadLib.
3. You can return to previous MadLibs, and fill them out again.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- `npm`
- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Bootstrap
- React Router
- Your favorite IDE

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ ] Go back to previous word or start over
- [ ] Fill out a story a second time w/o having to go back to Home first
- [ ] Add more stories! - maybe grab from API?
- [ ] AI generated images based on the user's filled-out story
- [ ] More CSS
